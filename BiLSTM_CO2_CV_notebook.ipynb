    "# BiLSTM Model – CO₂ Prediction with GroupKFold CV\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning model to predict surface seawater CO₂ concentrations (μatm) using multivariate time series data. The workflow includes preprocessing, windowing, GroupKFold cross-validation, feature importance (permutation method), and prediction export.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlights of this version:\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Input data:** 'Deception_2025_CO2_ocean_meteo_seismic.csv' should include oceanographic (seawater temperature anda salinity), meteorological (solar radiation, air temperature and wind speed), geosphysical (tidal heigh, seismic events), and spatiio-temporal variables (Date, latitude and longitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Grouping:** Based on latitude bins to account for spatial structure during GroupKFold.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Model:** BiLSTM architecture trained per fold with early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Evaluation metrics:** RMSE and R² computed for each fold.\n",

    "• **Feature importance:** Permutation-based increase in RMSE for each input variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Best fold selection:** Identified based on lowest RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "• `permutation_importance_fold.csv` → RMSE increase per variable per fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "• `Deception_2025_CO2_prediction.csv` → Original spatio-temporal and CO2 real data + new column 'CO2_predicted' from the best-performing fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "• Predicted values are descaled (inverse of z-score) before saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Best fold predictions are aligned with the original input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The model is ready for technical validation and integration into data descriptor papers or repositories.\n",

    "1. **Complete temporal context**: Access to both past and future information\n",
    "2. **Pattern recognition**: Better identification of temporal patterns\n",

    "## GroupKFold Cross-Validation and Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements a comprehensive cross-validation strategy with model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis specifically designed for spatial-temporal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Validation Strategy: GroupKFold\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why GroupKFold?**\n",
    "- **Spatial independence**: Prevents data leakage by ensuring spatially related samples don't appear in both training and validation sets\n",
    "- **Realistic evaluation**: Mimics real-world scenario where predictions are needed for new spatial locations\n",
    "- **Group definition**: Uses latitude-based spatial bins to define independent groups\n",
    "- **Splits**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Validation Strategy Benefits**:\n",
    "1. **Unbiased performance estimates**: Each fold tests on truly independent spatial regions\n",
    "2. **Generalization assessment**: Evaluates model's ability to predict at new locations\n",
    "3. **Robustness testing**: Multiple folds reveal model stability across different spatial configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Pipeline for Each Fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Data Splitting**\n",
    "- **Training set**: Samples from 4 spatial groups (80% of spatial coverage)\n",
    "- **Validation set**: Samples from 1 spatial group (20% of spatial coverage)\n",
    "- **Preservation**: Maintains temporal order within each spatial group\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Feature Scaling (Critical for Neural Networks)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Separate scalers for features and target\n",
    "scaler_X = StandardScaler()  # Features: mean=0, std=1\n",
    "scaler_y = StandardScaler()  # Target: normalized CO₂ values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Process**:\n",
    "1. **Fit on training data only**: Prevents data leakage from validation set\n",
    "2. **3D array handling**: Reshapes sequences for StandardScaler compatibility\n",
    "3. **Transform both sets**: Applies same scaling to training and validation data\n",
    "4. **Target scaling**: Normalizes CO₂ values for stable neural network training\n",
    "5. **Scaler preservation**: Stores scalers for inverse transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Model Training Configuration**\n",
    "- **Architecture**: Fresh BiLSTM model instance for each fold\n",
    "- **Input shape**: `(window_size, n_features)` = (10, 10)\n",
    "- **Training epochs**: Maximum 200 epochs\n",
    "- **Batch size**: 32 samples per batch for efficient training\n",
    "- **Data shuffling**: Enabled to prevent batch-level biases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Early Stopping Strategy**\n",
    "- **Monitor**: Validation loss (`val_loss`)\n",
    "- **Patience**: 15 epochs without improvement\n",
    "- **Restoration**: Automatically restores weights from best epoch\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Prevents overfitting while maximizing training effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Primary Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**\n",
    "- **Calculation**: `sqrt(mean((y_true - y_pred)²))`\n",
    "- **Units**: Same as target variable (μatm)\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Average prediction error magnitude\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Penalizes large errors more heavily than small ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Importance Analysis (Permutation Method):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Methodology**:\n",
    "1. **Baseline RMSE**: Calculate model performance on original validation data\n",
    "2. **Feature permutation**: Randomly shuffle each feature across time steps\n",
    "3. **Degraded performance**: Measure RMSE increase after permutation\n",
    "4. **Importance score**: `Permuted_RMSE - Baseline_RMSE`\n",
    "5. **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more important features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Permutation Process**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for each feature:\n",
    "    for each time_step in window:\n",
    "        randomly_shuffle(feature_values_at_time_step)\n",
    "    calculate_new_RMSE()\n",
    "    importance = new_RMSE - baseline_RMSE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output**: \n",
    "- **Per-fold CSV files**: `permutation_importance_fold{n}.csv`\n",
    "- **Contents**: Variable names and RMSE increase values\n",
    "- **Units**: μatm (same as prediction error)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Model Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Selection Criteria**:\n",
    "- **Metric**: Lowest validation RMSE across all folds\n",
    "- **Storage**: Complete model state including:\n",
    "  - True validation values (`y_true`)\n",
    "  - Predicted validation values (`y_pred`) \n",
    "  - Fold identifier\n",
    "  - Validation indices\n",
    "  - Scaler object for inverse transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Purpose**:\n",
    "- **Final predictions**: Use best-performing model for output generation\n",
    "- **Model deployment**: Identify optimal configuration for production use\n",
    "- **Performance reporting**: Represent model capability with best-case results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Tracking and Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stored Information per Fold**:\n",
    "- **Validation RMSE**: Performance metric for each fold\n",
    "- **Training history**: Loss curves and metrics over epochs\n",
    "- **Predictions**: True vs. predicted values for analysis\n",
    "- **Validation indices**: Sample identification for result alignment\n",
    "- **Scalers**: For proper inverse transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DataFrame Alignment**:\n",
    "- **df_val**: Aligned with validation set from final fold\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Maintains correspondence between predictions and original data\n",
    "- **Applications**: Result interpretation and spatial analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scaling Strategy**:\n",
    "- **Fold-specific scaling**: Each fold uses independent scalers to prevent information leakage\n",
    "- **Target scaling**: Essential for neural network convergence and stability\n",
    "- **Inverse transformation**: Required for interpretable results in original units\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Memory Management**:\n",
    "- **Sequential processing**: One fold at a time to manage memory usage\n",
    "- **Result accumulation**: Stores only essential information per fold\n",
    "- **Model disposal**: Implicit cleanup between folds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Reproducibility**:\n",
    "- **Permutation seeds**: `42 + fold` ensures consistent importance calculations\n",
    "- **Training shuffle**: Controlled randomness for reproducible training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome**: This comprehensive validation approach provides robust, unbiased estimates of model performance and feature importance, ensuring the BiLSTM model's reliability for CO₂ prediction in new spatial locations.\n"
