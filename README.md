# CO2_prediction_BiLSTM
This notebook implements a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning model to predict surface seawater CO₂ concentrations (μatm) using multivariate time series data. The workflow includes preprocessing, windowing, GroupKFold cross-validation, feature importance (permutation method), and prediction export.
